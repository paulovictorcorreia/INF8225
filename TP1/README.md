# TP1 - Baysian Networks, Classification

This folder contains the materials used for the TP! of the course INF8225 of Polytechnique Montreal. The task consisted of completing a notebook for 3 different tasks.

The first task consists of building a bayesian network with numpy multidimensional arrays of a modified version of Holmes and Watson garden problem. We had to infer certain probabilities from the network using probabilistic theory and also to infer certain statements of D-Separation as true or false.

The second task consists of coding a logistic regression classifier to discriminate between 10 types of clothing, as well as the stochastic gradient descent and Adam optimizers to get it work. After that we made a gridsearch to find the best parameters of the given task.

Finally, the third task consists of building a multilayer perceptron network as well as the backpropagation algorithm to classify the same 10 types of clothing. At the end we have a report with the results.
