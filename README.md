# INF8225

Repository for the projects and tasks of the INF8225 - I.A.:tech. probabilistes et d'apprentissage course of Polytechnique Montreal, supervised by Professor Christopher J. Pal.

**TP1** is divided in three parts. The first part consists of infering probabilities in a bayesian network, while also asserting if some statements are true based on probability theory. The second and the third consist of building Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron Networks  (MLP) using pytorch, while also coding the backpropagation for MLP, and stochastic gradient descent and Adam optimizers without using autograd features from pytorch.

**TP2** consists of a presentation of the paper [Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155). The paper in analysis presents a reinforcement learning with human feedback approach to train more truthful, less toxic and discriminating language models.

**TP3** consists of building a language model to translate sentences from english to french using attention transformers and recurrent neural networks such as the classic and the GRU. We compare the performance of the models with different sets of parameters

Finally, **TP4** stands for the final project of the course. We are going to use different architectures to process sequence to classify EEG signals on different classes. We will have all the code used, as well as the data and a report written in the IJCAI format.
